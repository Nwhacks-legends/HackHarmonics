## Inspiration
The inspiration behind HushHarmony arose from a shared desire for tranquility in everyday environments. In bustling urban spaces, finding quiet spots for work, relaxation, or socializing can be challenging. HushHarmony aims to empower individuals by providing them with the information needed to quickly navigate and discover quieter spaces, fostering a sense of well-being and control in their surroundings. This project is fueled by the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to make choices that positively impact their mental and physical health in the midst of the noise of modern life.

## What it does
HushHarmony is an innovative application designed to enhance users' daily experiences by providing real-time insights into the noise levels of indoor and outdoor spaces. Users can access information about the volume of a location, allowing them to make informed decisions for their well-being. Whether choosing a study spot, workspace, or social venue, HushHarmony empowers users to navigate and prioritize quieter environments for a healthier and more enjoyable lifestyle.

## How we built it
We used React for the front end of the web application, with Nodejs as the backend that makes calls to our MongoDB Database. For data collection, we decided to gather data on user’s mobile for greater accuracy. For the front-end of the mobile app, we used React Native, with backend as Nodejs.
- The indoor map is generated using MappedIn
- The outdoor map is generated by Google Maps
- The user’s location is gathered from GeoLocation API

#HushHarmony Introduction
## Challenges we ran into
1. Striking a balance between an aesthetically pleasing user interface and optimal user experience presented challenges in design decisions.
2. Achieving real-time updates for noise data on the map and ensuring seamless synchronization with user inputs demanded careful handling.	
3. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Rendering outside view within MappedIn was tricky
2. Aesthetically pleasing landing page
3. Integration of MappedIn into Web page

## What we learned
1. Able to support people with noise level requirements, whether it be health related or preferences
2. Working effectively by breaking down tasks
3. Teamwork and communication

## What's next for HushHarmony
1. Path finding while avoiding the busiest areas
2. Urgent care 
3. Sending the noises from web app to the DB to get more data points
4. Filter data depending on timestamp to avoid stale data

## Conclusion
By making aware of the users surrounding noise levels within their area, we aim to enhance safety and well-being. Just as our app keeps one informed about noise, we hope it serves as a silent companion, ensuring one navigates through life with confidence and tranquility.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
